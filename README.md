## About

This repository contains various Java programs that I will be developing as I learn the language. The programs range from basic syntax and control structures to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the programs in this repository, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download and install Java from the official website: [Oracle Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SameerNadaf/JavaProgramming.git
```

### Compile and Run Java Programs

Navigate to the directory of the program you want to run and use the following commands to compile and run the Java program:

```sh
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```
